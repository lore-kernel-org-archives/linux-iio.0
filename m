IMO the mounting matrix is more consistent with the IIO ABIs. Although
I have no issue with repicating _PLD for device tree if people agree
that it is better.

The upstream standard for those sensors where the orientation matters
(accelerometer, gyro, compass) is IIO.

Granted, there are other device types for which the orientation
information may be useful (e.g. camera). However the actual
interpretation and action to be taken is different for each subsystem
(e.g. in the camera case do the correction via V4L2_CID_HFLIP /
V4L2_CID_VFLIP) so I think it is better to expose it at the subsystem
level in a way consistent with the subsystem's ABIs.
