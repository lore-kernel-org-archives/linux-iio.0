If the main reason for implementing a new ABI is to support DT 
platforms, Why not implement a version of _PLD for device tree ? Don't 
you think it would be much better than adding a new ABI to export 
redundant information ?

Also the location information of the device is not just specific to iio 
drivers. You should consider that we would have similar requirements for 
devices implemented as input or platform drivers.
