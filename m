Sadly its ABI now so we can't realistically change it.  We can extend, we can't
replace (we we can over the course of a lot of years but that's a nightmare).

The oddity here is that in your case the device in interacting with a stimulus
output.  Normally the index reflects an actual sensor.  We are kind of bludgeoning
it in. The only equivalently nasty case I know of is touch screens where different
resistances are being connected - from a generic point of view those are a nightmare
as well (as every implementation does it differently).

See my reply to the cover letter thread.  You can't pass a name in an event
to userspace and we'd end up string matching all over the place or you end
up not encoding the information currently in the modifier at all.  

Perhaps you are right in that it would still have been neater but such is hind sight!

The one I wonder about occasionally is similar to what you suggest, but don't
ever having anything other than number (and I'd keep the differential channels.
Then have an extra sysfs attribute that provides the modifier string.

Then I'm not sure it gains us much.
Also note that in the classic ADC case (and there are a whole load more
of those than weird light sensors ;) there are only indexes and differential channels
so it all becomes rather cleaner.

in_voltage0-1_raw 

It's also worth noting that whilst we do allow freeform extend_name elements
they are very rarely accepted in drivers as the moment you do that you have
something that standard userspace code won't know what to do with.

There is - abi compliance.  We are simply not going to have two different ABIs.
Your use case may involve only drivers that are used with custom userspace code
(afterall this one isn't much use without a load of processing) but the 
vast majority of drivers are generic and talk to the same userspace.

So whilst this is an interesting discussion, it's effectively an academic
exercise.  We have an ABI. What's there is effectively set in stone.  New
drivers that do the same thing as existing drivers MUST use the existing
ABI..

Where we have flexibility is to extend the ABI for devices that haven't
been supported before.

Just a small point, but if the exposed interface of a driver to userspace
requires reading the datasheet to understand it, it's not a great starting point.
These are kind of 'magic calibration parameters' so I'm not that bothered.

Would it ever make sense to set them like whilst streaming?  I've no idea!

You can do that, but then you need to provide

This is still nasty as it's not really it's a channel reading an arbitrary combination
of led signal and ambient.  Yes the LED bit is for led 1, but there is nothing here indicating
that a fair bit of the signal may well come from elsewhere.

If there is going to be more than one of them and a common userspace library

The point is to extend it within the general structure of the framework. Of course
it needs to be extended for each new device type.  When we first got an accelerometer
did you expect us to pretend it was an ADC because that's all the framework supported
at the time?

This is measuring something new, hence not unreasonable to extend the ABI to cope with
it. Future devices measuring the same thing will have to use the ABI we define here.

Yes, the framework grows over time, and yes it needs to be extended. This is only
natural as new devices turn up that do new things.

Be careful to note that your strings naming the things would be just as much part of
the ABI as any new modifier or channel type.

If the framework is not general enough it needs to be extended.

I do see where you are coming from. Perhaps if we were starting again we could explore
whether it is possible to overcome the issues that drove us to modifiers in the first
place.

Perhaps we can extend the abi to include your naming suggestion (though I would not
include it in the sysfs attribute names, but rather as an additional field) but
it could only be used in cases where we are defining new ABI, not as a replacement
for existing ABI.

Because the next datasheet that comes along for a different part might call
them something subtly different then we end up with needing custom userspace
code for each part.  If we do that then there is no point in having the devices
in IIO in the first place.   The reason all this ABI needs to be considered from
a generic point of view is that we are setting precedence.  Naming should not
be defined by what it happened to be called on the particular instance of
the datasheet against which the first driver was defined (and yes we have
had instances of the names changing entirely on datasheets).

The point is to come up with ABI that is generic. That is probably the most
important part of IIO (and the bit we spend most time discussing / arguing about).

This is a calibration offset applied to the incoming signal - arguably by calling
offdac_led1 you are obscuring the useful information to the user which is 'what
is this for?'.

This is ABI - hence the first driver set precedence. What these do is not really part specific
so we should work out generic ABI.

They can still be sysfs only and channels.
Just set the scan_index for them to -1.

One advantage of this is that they become accessible to other users within the kernel
(why they'd want to access them I have no idea ;)
