I didn't get any warnings with mine, so if you don't care either way
I would prefer this way as it feels more consistent to me, we also
can see the successful return value without tracking down what the
last 'ret' assignment considers success.

The rational for this should be more clear when I break off
all the common code that this allows us.

Possibly similar reason to this, will fix.
