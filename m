Hi Andrew,

Good to see this resurface.  It's a fascinating little device.

Anyhow, most of the interesting bit in here is unsuprisingly concerned
with the interface.  I know we went round a few loops of this before but
it still feels like we haven't worked out to handle it well.  I would like
as much input as we can get on this as inevitablly it will have
repercussions outside this driver.

Your approach of hammering out descriptive sysfs attributes is a good
starting point but we need to work towards a formal description that
can be generalised.  Whilst there are not many similar devices out there
to this one, I suspect there are a few and more may well show up in
future.

The escence of my rather roundabout response inline is that I'm suggesting
adding a new channel type to represent light transmission, taking the analogous
case of proximity devices in which we are looking at light reflection.
I've also taken the justification we use for illuminance vs intensity readings
for two sensor ALS sensors as a precident for having compound channels of a different
type to the 'raw' data that feeds them.  Hence I propose something along
the lines of:

in_intensityX_raw (raw channel value with the led on)
in_intensityX_ambient_raw (raw channel value with the led off)

in_intensitytransmittedX_raw the differential signal which is actually just
measuring the proportion of light that got through the finger or similar.
(other naming suggestions welcome!)

Lots more detail inline, but I wanted anyone at a quick glance to know
what we are discussing.  Perhaps my suggestion is bonkers so feel free
to pick it to shreds.

The average channels are also unusual to handle.  When would a user
want to get both the average and non average channel via the triggered
buffer?   I propose that we might handle these generically by treating
the averaging process as a filter and extending the filter interface to
describe it.

I also do feel that the modularity you have driven for to support your
other part has perhaps come at the expense of some false complexity
(I think there are easier to follow ways of keeping thing modular without
 as many duplicate copies of pointers as you pass around here).
 
Jonathan

p.s. Seemed like a good idea to look at this on a Sunday evening
to avoid some truely terrible TV...  Now for the TV I think!

These are defined types, so need to be in the relevant defined base units.
I know it is a pain to map real world values directly to the driver units
but if it actually makes sense to expose these to userspace they need to
defined in the same units as every other element of that type is - so
if you don't provide a scale for the 'channels' then it should be
nanofarads and ohms.

Could be handled as an output channel internaly with and extended_name -
this sort of internally handled value is exactly what
the extended_name stuff is meant to be used to identify.

These are really controlling a front end analog filter, so another option would
be to use the filter description attributes to handle this.  They are however
somewhat 'minimalist' for this case so would need extending. (this will also
get complex if we start describing the average channel as a filtered channel
as well).

This is an 'interesting' one.  Might be cleaner to just have both values exposed
and switch this on and off depending on whether they are equal?  That way we
don't need the custom interface.
Perhaps we need a brief description of why one might not want separate control?
(i.e. if we have separate control and set them to the same value, what do we lose?)

Existence of this attribute is fine, but you need to do the relevant
handling to allow it to be a standard current channel. You can't have the
mysterious * 0.8mA.  Also it should be called out_currentX_led_raw
(so led is an extended name)  IIRC we do this for some proximity sensors.

These are getting a little bit 'clunky' in naming.  Could map them back to
the simpler

in_intensityX_raw and in_intensityX_ambient_raw and rely on the channel index
to associate them with an LED.

The led version of ambient strikes me as odd to start with given I think the LED
is turned off during that measurement?  This is merely to do with when they
occur in the sequence?

What we are really dealing with here is a single photodiode and an led sequencer.
Perhaps we need a modifier that simply means the source is an led driven at the same instance?
(this is the same as for proximity sensors, but there the signal is explicitly proximity).

Maybe, we should be treating these as a different type entirely?  They are measuring light
levels, but in common with proximity sensors the 'interesting' bit is what is effecting
those levels.  Perhaps a new type would make sense.
How about:

in_intensitytransmittedX_raw
in_intensityX_raw

This makes a mess of the differential channels however, as suddenly they are taking the
difference of two signals of different types.  Ah well there goes a good plan.  I'd neglected
that the transmitted version is the combination of the ambient and the transmitted.

This is irritatingly hard to map onto anything generic.

Perhaps the next thing is to think of these a bit like the ALS sensors that use
two sensors to work out what the illuminance is and do it similar to that (somewhat
hiding the relationship).  In that case we'd have

in_intensityX_ambient_raw
in_intensityX_raw (transmitted and ambient - maybe some modifier to indicate this
- like we do for the hideous 'both' modifier for the visible + infrared sensitive
element is some ALSs? - note both seemed sensible at the time, now the name seems
bonkers - oops.)

and the differential would become
in_intensitytransmittedX_raw

In the ALS analogy the transform is often horribly non linear so could
never be represented as a differential channel (unlike here). Maybe
from a userspace interface point of view the best bet here is to not represent
it as a differential channel... Are all such light sensors even linear - here the
assumption is the connected diode is. Perhaps that won't always hold true in future.

(this is my favourite option at the moment)

Oh goody another weird one ;)  I note in the current proposal, it's not obvious
that the mean acutally applies to the differential.  Another element in favour
of the new channel type option.

We do have a chan info element for average raw that would do the job for the sysfs
attribute.   However, as you are pushing this into the buffer, it doesn't work for
us here.

This is basically a low pass filtered version of the signal, so one option would
be a duplicate channel that has the addition of filter attributes to describe that
the filter applied (similar to the existing low pass filter controls).

The challenge would be making it clear that the channel is infact the same as the
led2 channel but with the filter.

Actually, odd question, but why would someone want both the unfiltered and filtered
versions via the buffered interface?

Are these in mA?

Not sure I like the naming here.  You could either treat them as explicit output
channels, or (and I'd be tempted to favour this) as calibration offsets for the
in_intensitytransmitted_ channel described above (or maybe the straight intensity
channels - I'm now confused on what is what here!).

Maybe say 'AFE4404 specific registers' to make it clear

Is it worth considering the regmap field stuff?  That
way all this could go into the field defintions, and
perhaps then give a cleaner driver?

I'd be tempted to represent this as a lookup table instead
of this set of defines.  This is particular true
in light of the fact the sysfs attribute needs to map them
to standard units. Given that will need to be in nano farads
and these are pico you only need the 'val2 part' and use the
int_plus_micro form.  The search will be rather more iritating
as these are in a non obvious order, but such is life.

Hence (I'd use the C99 asignments stuff to make it obvious
that the index is important!)

static const int afe4404_tia_gain_caps_femto_farads[] = {
      [0] = 5000,
      [1] = 2500,
      [2] = 10000,
      [3] = 7500,
      [4] = 20000,
      [5] = 17500,
      [6] = 25000,
      [7] = 22500 };

I talk about these above.  They look to me like they should either be treated as output
channels or possibly as controls on a filter (which is what they really are)

Again, talked about earlier.  These could be treated as calibration offsets (similar to
the ones applied to trim gyros in high end IMUs for example).

This stuff makes me wonder whether we are anywhere near descriptive enough of the analog
front ends to devices we support.  Probably not I guess!

We already do this for some proximity sensors - just might be better to represent them
as straight forward output channels.  I suppose if we really get into it they
are output intensity channels, but perhaps best to ignore that.

There should be no need to set *val2 as it's never read if the return
is IIO_VAL_INT.  Nothing wrong with paranoia however ;)

So there are 9 channels?  Then you need space for the timestamp that needs
to be 8 byte aligned. Hence this needs to be s32 buffer[12].
(iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp is rather odd  - see the documentation)

Why using the version in afe440x (which arguably shouldn't be there)
rather than the one in indio_dev->channels[bit].address?

Hmm. I guess this more of the stuff from this being a highly modular driver.
Right now that is really hurting the organisation of the code.

You'd be better off just using the devm_iio_device_alloc call to allocate
both your private data and the iio device data.  You could then pass the
iio_dev to your iio_setup function if you really want to.
Not bouncing through having copies of everything in your afe440x structure
would also make it a lot cleaner without hurting your modularity substantially.

I can see that you were aiming to completely separate the iio side
from the more generic driver parts, but that division is all a bit blured and
leads to more complex code.

This is used in remarkably few places and those are all effectively
in the device probe.  Perhaps just passing it directly would make sense.

Why have another instance of name given it's held in the iio_dev anyway?

> +	struct spi_device *spi;
Not used anywhere that I can find. 

> +	struct mutex iolock;
Another one not used anywhere (left-overs from pre regmap?)

Having the above in here as well makes limited sense given the versions
in iio_dev are identical.

I'm guessing some of this was due to how the modular stuff you refer
to in the cover letter was done.  However, I'm suspecting that was
done less than cleanly to end up with this mixture of constant and non
constant elements in here.  There should have been a chip_info structure
consisting of entirely constant elements (such as channels etc) rather than
this combined structure.

> +	const struct iio_info *info;
Again, can't see any reason to ever have this directly in here.
