Since there is no asynchronous queue for commands to be executed in IIO 
adding a asynchronous completion event doesn't make too much sense. This is 
something that needs to be handled at the HAL level.

The HAL needs to have a queue of commands that need to be executed where new 
events can be added asynchronously, then has a loop which goes through the 
commands in the queue and executes them, and once executed generated the 
appropriate completion event.

I really wish that document would specify what is actually meant by flush. 
Copy the FIFO content to a software buffer or discard the FIFO content.

I'd prefer this to be handled through the normal read() API rather than 
having a side channel for it. Big question is how though. We could specify 
that reading in O_NONBLOCK mode will always read data if it is available and 
not only if it is above the watermark threshold.
